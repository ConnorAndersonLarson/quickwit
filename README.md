## About the Project

QuickWit is an application designed for users to quickly learn about top stories published by the New York Times. This take home tech challenge implemented the New York Times API Top Stories API [(view documentation)](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview) to display top stories basic information. Users have the ability look through all top stories and can sort stories based on relevant story tags. When a user selects an article they can view that article's abstract, a photo (if applicable), and have the option to go to the New York Times website to read the full article. The take home challenge was reccommended to take approximately 6 hours. The project specs and rubic are from the Turing School of Software and Design and can be seen [here for the specs](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod4-tech-challenges/blob/main/take-homes/fe-take-home.md) and [here for the rubric](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod4-tech-challenges/blob/main/take-homes/take-home-rubric.md).
